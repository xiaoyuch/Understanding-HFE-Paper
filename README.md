- Title: **Evaluation of Ecological Interface Design for Nuclear Process Control: Situation Awareness Effects**
## Outcome of your reading: 
### 1. Understand the following concepts:
- Ecological interface design (EID)
    - Definition
    - Difference with traditional and user-centered displays
    - Advantages and disadvantages
- Situation awareness (SA)
    - Definition
    - How to measure/evaluate/quantify, what measure can be effective indicator for SA
    - What is three-level model
- Nuclear process control
    - Definition
    - What is full-scope simulator
    - What are complex scenarios
- Procedural support
    - What is procedural support
    - Why using procedural support
- Operator performance
    - How to measure performance
    - How to analyze performance
- Design of experiment (DOE)
    - What is between-subject design
    - What is within-subject design
    - Any other DOE types
    - Why DOE is important
### 2. Answer the following questions
- What is the research objective
- What are the research questions/challenges
- What are the hypotheses, how to test them, and what are the benefits to test them
- Why is this research important for nuclear process control
- What procedures were the authors used for evaluation (summarize in details)
- What design of experiment types were used (e.g., between-subject design, within-subject design, etc.)
- How to analyze the data collected from the experiments
- What are the major findings from this research
- How will these major findings affect the effectiveness and efficiency of human operators in process control (contributions to industries)
- How will this research benefit user interface design research community (contributions to acadamia)
- What data can you collect from the experimentsdescribed in this paper
###  3. Think deeper towards the following open questions
- What are the limitations of this research
- Any other hypotheses you would like to test given the conducted experiments in this research and what are the benefits to test your hypotheses (justification)
- How can you improve the experiment design if you are the investigator
- Given more sensors (e.g., eye tracker, EEG, body motion tracking, finger motion tracking, etc.), can you generate more hypotheses to be tested, and what are the benefits
- How can you create an EID design for process control on an augmented reality device? What can be potential advantages and disadvantages?
- Given these three displays (i.e., EID,traditional,and user-centered display), can youimagine and create anew display which you expectto be more effective andmore efficient? Draftthings in you head either by handor powerpoints
## Deliverable
- A powerpoint with three sections which answer the above questions in details
- Requirments:
    - Three sections for three group of questions
    - Each slide need to summarize a question or part of a question as the title, then use the content to answer the question
    - Add page number to each slide
    - Draw figures by hand is acceptable to explain your thoughts
    - Use your imagenation!
